//Convert a adjacent list graph representation to linear equations
//Convert linear equations to a matrix form
//Transpose the matrix to transform a minimization problem into a maximization problem
//Now add slack columns and Z and C columns to the matrix
//Use the simplex algorithm to solve the above maximization problem
